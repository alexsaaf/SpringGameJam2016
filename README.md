# Left for Schlager (LIU SpringGameJam2016)
Left for Schlager is a game made in 48 hours where you fight your way past emotional zombies to get to the Ericsson Globe to see the Eurovision Song Contest. Left for Schlager is a first person shooter game, combined with a top-down 3D-game. The player can control both the First person character, but also a drone flying in the sky. The drone and the weapoons both drain energy, which means that the player must choose what to spend the energy on.
